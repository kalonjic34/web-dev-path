# Update to "Building a First Website: HTML & CSS Basics"

## My Daily Challenge Overview

In this update, I expanded my project by creating two distinct pages: the Daily Challenge page and the Upcoming Challenges page. This iteration allowed me to apply the concepts I previously learned and to implement new skills in HTML and CSS. Below is a detailed overview of what I accomplished and the insights I gained.

## Key Learnings

### 1. Page Structure and Organization

- **Creating Separate Pages**: I structured my project into multiple HTML files, facilitating a clearer organization of content. This separation allows for easier navigation and a more user-friendly experience.
- **Semantic HTML**: I continued to use semantic HTML elements such as `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`, reinforcing the importance of meaningful markup for accessibility and SEO.

### 2. Advanced CSS Techniques

- **Styling with CSS**: I applied CSS rules to enhance the visual appeal of both pages. By defining styles for different elements, I was able to create a cohesive and attractive layout.
- **Using External Stylesheets**: I linked multiple CSS files (`daily-challenge.css`, `full-week.css`, and `shared.css`) to manage styles effectively. This approach promotes reusability and keeps styles organized.

### 3. Visual Design Enhancements

- **Color Schemes and Typography**: I chose a consistent color palette and typography across both pages. Utilizing Google Fonts, I incorporated 'Fira Sans' and 'Oswald' to create a modern and legible text presentation.
- **Image Styling**: I styled images, specifically the trophy image in the Daily Challenge page, to enhance its appearance. The use of `border-radius` created a circular image, contributing to a polished design.

### 4. User Interaction and Experience

- **Interactive Links**: I added hover effects to navigation links for both pages, providing immediate visual feedback and enhancing user experience.
- **Highlighting Content**: On the Upcoming Challenges page, I implemented a highlight class to emphasize specific goals. This feature improves visibility and draws attention to important tasks.

### 5. Consistent Layout and Responsiveness

- **Layout Management**: I used CSS properties like `margin` and `padding` to ensure a well-structured layout on both pages. The main content areas are centrally aligned with appropriate spacing, making it visually appealing and easy to read.
- **Responsive Design Considerations**: I began to consider how my layout would adapt to different screen sizes, laying the groundwork for future responsive design techniques.

## What I Did

### Page Details

- **Daily Challenge Page**:
  - Features a header with a motivational title, a trophy image to symbolize achievements, and a description of the dayâ€™s challenge.
  - Designed the main section with a distinct background color, padding, and borders to create an inviting space for users.

- **Upcoming Challenges Page**:
  - Outlines future tasks with specific dates and detailed descriptions.
  - Utilizes an ordered list to present challenges clearly, with highlight classes to emphasize key goals.

### CSS Files Overview

- **`shared.css`**: 
  - Contains common styles applied across both pages, ensuring consistency in fonts, colors, and layout.
  
- **`daily-challenge.css`**: 
  - Tailored styles for the Daily Challenge page, emphasizing the background color, borders, and image styling.

- **`full-week.css`**: 
  - Styles specific to the Upcoming Challenges page, ensuring a cohesive design while highlighting important tasks.

## Conclusion

This update marked a significant step forward in my web development journey, reinforcing my understanding of HTML and CSS while introducing new concepts and techniques. I have gained practical experience in creating and styling multiple web pages, focusing on user experience and visual appeal.
