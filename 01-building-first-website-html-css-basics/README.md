# Building a First Website: HTML & CSS Basics

## My Daily Challenge Overview

Throughout this project, I focused on the fundamentals of web development, specifically HTML and CSS. Here are the key concepts I explored:

1. **HTML Structure**:
   - Learned how to create a basic HTML document by understanding the roles of `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags. 
   - Explored the significance of semantic HTML elements, which improve accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO) by providing meaningful structure.

2. **CSS Styling**:
   - Discovered how to link external CSS stylesheets using the `<link>` tag, which allows for better organization and separation of content and presentation.
   - Utilized Google Fonts to enhance typography, specifically using 'Fira Sans' for body text and 'Oswald' for headings, which improved the overall aesthetic and readability of the text.
   - Applied CSS styles for various elements, including headings, paragraphs, and images, to create a visually appealing layout and ensure a consistent design across the pages.

3. **Responsive Design**:
   - Ensured images maintain a consistent size and shape using CSS properties like `width`, `height`, and `border-radius`, which create a polished look and feel.
   - Experimented with centering text and setting background colors to create a cohesive and inviting user experience. The background color, specifically, was chosen to be warm and welcoming.

4. **Linking Pages**:
   - Created navigation links between different pages, allowing users to explore challenges and resources easily. This included linking from the Daily Challenge page to the Upcoming Challenges page, fostering a sense of continuity and progression in learning.

5. **User Experience (UX) Principles**:
   - Considered user experience in the design, ensuring that text is legible, links are easily identifiable, and the overall layout is intuitive. This included hover effects on links to provide visual feedback when interacted with.
   - Emphasized the importance of visual hierarchy through the use of font sizes and colors, making it easier for users to navigate and understand the content.

## What I've Done

### Project Structure

- **HTML Files**:
  - **Daily Challenge Page**: This page features an engaging header, a detailed description of the day's challenge, and an image of a trophy to symbolize achievement. The content encourages users to dive into the basics of web development.
  - **Upcoming Challenges Page**: This page outlines future tasks, emphasizing the importance of repetition and continuous learning. It includes links that guide users back to the Daily Challenge for a seamless learning experience.

### CSS Files

- **`shared.css`**: 
  - Established common styles for both pages, including a cohesive background color (rgb(233, 215, 207)) and text alignment, which enhances readability. The stylesheet also standardizes font family settings for headings and paragraphs, contributing to a unified look.

- **`daily-challenge.css`**: 
  - Customized styles specific to the Daily Challenge page, including setting margins and specific font sizes for emphasis on key areas. The styling choices were made to ensure that important information stands out, such as the challenge description.

### Visual Elements

- Added a trophy image to symbolize achievement and motivation, which serves as a visual cue for users to engage with the content actively. The image is styled to be circular, giving it a modern and appealing look.
- Styled the "Today's Challenge" section to stand out, using bold text and a larger font size to draw attention to the key message of the day.

## Conclusion

This project reinforced my understanding of HTML and CSS, particularly in structuring web pages and applying styles effectively. I gained practical experience in linking pages, managing CSS files, and creating a visually appealing layout that enhances user experience.
